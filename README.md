# Enhanced Inbox Security: Spam Mail Detection

This project focuses on enhancing inbox security by detecting spam emails. Through preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes models, we aimed to accurately predict spam emails and contribute to achieving a high F1 Score of 99%.

## Approach:

1. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the email data to handle missing values, remove noise, and standardize the text.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, identify important features, and gain insights into the underlying patterns.

3. **Model Implementation:** Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers to train models on the preprocessed data.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved an impressive F1 Score of 99%.

## Results:

- Gaussian Naive Bayes: 91%
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: 97%
